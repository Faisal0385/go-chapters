1. What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
In Go, pointers are declared using the * symbol (e.g., *int is a pointer to an integer).
Pointers are useful when you want to directly modify a variable’s value or avoid copying large data.

2. Line-by-Line Breakdown

Line 1: var p *int
  This declares a variable p that is a pointer to an integer (*int).
  Since you didn’t initialize p, it gets the zero value for a pointer in Go, which is nil.
  nil means the pointer doesn’t point to any valid memory address yet.
  At this point, p is a pointer variable, but it’s not pointing to any int value.
Line 2: fmt.Println(&p)
  The & operator gives the memory address of a variable.
  Here, &p is the address of the pointer variable p itself, not the address it might point to.
  Every variable in Go (including pointers) has its own memory address where it’s stored.
  This line prints the memory address where the pointer p is stored (e.g., something like 0xc000014028, a hexadecimal address). The exact address will vary each time you run the program.
Line 3: fmt.Println(p)
  This prints the value of p, which is the address that p is pointing to.
  Since p was declared but not assigned to point to any int variable, its value is nil.
  In Go, nil is the zero value for pointers, meaning “no address” or “not pointing to anything.”
  This line will output: <nil>.

3. Key Concepts
  Pointer variable vs. what it points to:
  p is a pointer variable that can hold the address of an int.
  &p is the address of p itself in memory.
  p holds the address of the int it points to (or nil if uninitialized).
  If you tried to access *p (the value at the address p points to), it would cause a panic because p is nil and doesn’t point to a valid memory location.
  Why two different outputs?
  &p gives the address of the pointer variable p (where p is stored in memory).
  p gives the value of p, which is nil because it hasn’t been assigned to point to any int.
