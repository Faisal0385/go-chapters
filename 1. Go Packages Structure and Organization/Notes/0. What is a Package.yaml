What is a Package?
    A collection of Go source files in a single directory is know as Package.

NOTE: 
    In Go, all the source files (files ending with .go) located in a single directory are treated as 
    part of the same package. For example, if we have a directory named utils with files like math.go, 
    string.go, and date.go, all these files together form the utils package.

Package can be divide into Main Package or Non-main Package.
