9. Development vs. Production:
    
  During development, we often use the go run command to execute our code:
    Syntax: go run <filename>
    Running in Development: go run main.go

  For production, we typically use: go build
    Another Command: go run --work .\main.go 
    
    This creates an executable file that can be distributed or run independently, 
    even on systems without Go installed.
      - On Windows, the output is firstapp.exe
      - On Linux/Mac, the output is firstapp

    Why use go build?
    It ensures our application is compiled into a standalone binary that can run on any compatible system 
    without requiring Go to be installed.
